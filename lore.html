            <h2>The 10 Commandments of CMU Pickleball</h2>
            <p>Just as America was founded on Christianity, CMU Pickleball was founded on Tristianity, in honor of one
                of our pioneering founders: Tristan Ohler. Don't understand the Tristian principles? Well, look no
                further than our sacred 10 commandments...</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The serve must be made underhand.</li>
                <li>Serve must be directed diagonally to the opponent's service zone.</li>
                <li>Serve must land within the confines of the service court (if it lands in the kitchen, it is out).
                </li>
                <li>Only one fault is allowed on the serve. Faults include serving out of bounds and into the net.</li>
                <li>After the serve, players on both teams must let the ball bounce once before hitting it.</li>
                <li>Volleys (hitting the ball in the air without a bounce) are not allowed in the kitchen.</li>
                <li>Players cannot step into the non-volley zone unless the ball has bounced first.</li>
                <li>A player's momentum must carry them out of the non-volley zone before they can volley the ball.</li>
                <li>The game is played to 11 points, and a team must win by 2 points.</li>
                <li>When the ball is served, both players on the serving team must let it bounce before playing it.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>A Prayer for CMU Pickleball</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;">"In the name of the forehand, and the backhand, and the overhead smash, we
                gather on the courts of
                CMU Pickleball. May our serves be true and our volleys be swift. Grant us agility like Pete the Pickle
                and the camaraderie of pickleball friends. Let our rallies be long and our spirits be high. May the joy
                of the game and the thrill of competition guide us always. Amen."</p>
