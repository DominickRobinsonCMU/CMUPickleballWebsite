                Hey pickles, <br> <br>

                Welcome to CMU Pickleball! While we began not too long ago in Spring 2023, we are already a
                fully-formed club filled with excellent culture and tons of fun. <br><br>

                We host tons of events, including weekly open play, hosting tournaments, travelling to tournaments and
                colleges, and much more.<br><br>

                If you want to see what CMU Pickleball is all about, please check out the <a href="links.html">Links
                    Tab</a>,
                which links to
                our social medias. We heavily document club activities, and we try to post everything to our
                YouTube and Instagram accounts. <br><br>

                If you want to learn pickleball, play in casual or competitive environments, or are generally a fan of
                racket sports, look no further than CMU Pickleball! <br><br>

                Dink ya later,<br>
